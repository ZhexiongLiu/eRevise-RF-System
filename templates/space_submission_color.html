Indeed, over 46.2 million Americans (15%) live in poverty. Nearly half of all Americans also have <span style='background-color:#FF00FF'>difficulty paying for housing, food, and medicine at<sub>[TOPIC:TANGIBLE_BENEFITS]</sub></span> some point in their lives. In other countries, <span style='background-color:#00FF00'>people are dying because they do not have<sub>[TOPIC:HELP_PEOPLE]</sub></span> <span style='background-color:yellow'>access to clean water, medical care, or simple<sub>[TOPIC:HELP_ENVIRONMENT]</sub></span> solutions that prevent the spread of diseases. For <span style='background-color:#00FF00'>example, malaria, a disease spread by mosquito bites,<sub>[TOPIC:HELP_PEOPLE]</sub></span> <span style='background-color:#00FF00'>kills many people in Africa every year. It<sub>[TOPIC:HELP_PEOPLE]</sub></span> is possible to lower the spread of this <span style='background-color:#00FF00'>disease by hanging large nets over beds that<sub>[TOPIC:HELP_PEOPLE]</sub></span> <span style='background-color:#00FF00'>protect people from being bitten as they sleep.<sub>[TOPIC:HELP_PEOPLE]</sub></span> <span style='background-color:#00FF00'>These nets cost only $5; however, most people<sub>[TOPIC:HELP_PEOPLE]</sub></span> affected by malaria cannot afford these nets.  It <span style='background-color:#00FF00'>is not just people that need help. The<sub>[TOPIC:HELP_PEOPLE]</sub></span> <span style='background-color:#FF00FF'>Earth is suffering also. Many scientists believe that<sub>[TOPIC:TANGIBLE_BENEFITS]</sub></span> <span style='background-color:yellow'>pollution from burning fossil fuels (gasoline and oil)<sub>[TOPIC:HELP_ENVIRONMENT]</sub></span> <span style='background-color:yellow'>is harming our air and oceans. We need<sub>[TOPIC:HELP_ENVIRONMENT]</sub></span> <span style='background-color:yellow'>new, cleaner forms of energy to power cars,<sub>[TOPIC:HELP_ENVIRONMENT]</sub></span> <span style='background-color:yellow'>homes, and factories. A program to develop clean<sub>[TOPIC:HELP_ENVIRONMENT]</sub></span> <span style='background-color:yellow'>energy could be viewed as a worthy investment.<sub>[TOPIC:HELP_ENVIRONMENT]</sub></span>  <span style='background-color:#00CDFF'>Maybe exploring space should not be a priority<sub>[TOPIC:SPIRIT_OF_EXPLORATION]</sub></span> when there is so much that needs to be done on Earth. Right now, the government <span style='background-color:yellow'>spends 19 billion dollars a year for space<sub>[TOPIC:HELP_ENVIRONMENT]</sub></span> <span style='background-color:#00FF00'>exploration. Some people think that this money should<sub>[TOPIC:HELP_PEOPLE]</sub></span> <span style='background-color:yellow'>be spent instead to help heal the people<sub>[TOPIC:HELP_ENVIRONMENT]</sub></span> and the Earth.  Tangible Benefits of Space Exploration  <span style='background-color:#00FF00'>People in favor of space exploration argue that<sub>[TOPIC:HELP_PEOPLE]</sub></span> <span style='background-color:yellow'>19 billion dollars is not too much. It<sub>[TOPIC:HELP_ENVIRONMENT]</sub></span> is only 1.2% of the total national budget. <span style='background-color:yellow'>Compare this to the 670 billion dollars the<sub>[TOPIC:HELP_ENVIRONMENT]</sub></span> US spends for national defense (26.3% of the <span style='background-color:yellow'>national budget), or the 70 billion dollars spent<sub>[TOPIC:HELP_ENVIRONMENT]</sub></span> on education (4.8% of the budget), or the <span style='background-color:yellow'>6.3 billion dollars spent on renewable (clean) energy.<sub>[TOPIC:HELP_ENVIRONMENT]</sub></span>  <span style='background-color:yellow'>The investment in space exploration is especially worthwhile<sub>[TOPIC:HELP_ENVIRONMENT]</sub></span> because it has led to many tangible benefits, for example, in the area of medicine. Before <span style='background-color:#FF00FF'>NASA allowed astronauts to go on missions, scientists<sub>[TOPIC:TANGIBLE_BENEFITS]</sub></span> <span style='background-color:#FF00FF'>had to find ways to monitor their health<sub>[TOPIC:TANGIBLE_BENEFITS]</sub></span> under stressful conditions. This was to ensure the <span style='background-color:#FF00FF'>safety of the astronauts under harsh conditions, like<sub>[TOPIC:TANGIBLE_BENEFITS]</sub></span> those they would experience on launch and return. <span style='background-color:#FF00FF'>In doing this, medical instruments were developed and<sub>[TOPIC:TANGIBLE_BENEFITS]</sub></span> <span style='background-color:#FF00FF'>doctors learned about the human body's reaction to<sub>[TOPIC:TANGIBLE_BENEFITS]</sub></span> stress.
