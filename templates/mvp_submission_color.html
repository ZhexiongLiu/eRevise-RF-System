The author convinced me that this goal is achievable because of how much Kenya has grown in only eight years. Sauri, Kenya started out <span style='background-color:#00CDFF'>rough in many ways, but has also come<sub>[TOPIC:SCHOOL]</sub></span> a long way in such a short period <span style='background-color:#00FF00'>of time. There are many reasons why I<sub>[TOPIC:HOSPITALS]</sub></span> believe that Sauri, Africa can reach its goal by 2025-2035. "I hope that the author of this passage convinced you too. One reason why I think Kenya has a change of growing more is because they had the strength to pull through." For example, in paragraph 11 it says "The people of Sauri have made amazing progress in just eight years." This just goes <span style='background-color:#00FF00'>to show that if you are willing to,<sub>[TOPIC:HOSPITALS]</sub></span> you can accomplish anything. " Another reason why I think Sauri will grow more by 2025 or 2035 is because it talks about how <span style='background-color:#FF00FF'>food production has increased."It says in paragraph 11<sub>[TOPIC:FARMING]</sub></span> that "The hunger crisis has been addressed with <span style='background-color:#FF00FF'>fertilizer and seeds." This means that Sauri now<sub>[TOPIC:FARMING]</sub></span> <span style='background-color:#FF00FF'>has food for the entire village, and the<sub>[TOPIC:FARMING]</sub></span> <span style='background-color:#00CDFF'>kids at the school get food now. "Sauri<sub>[TOPIC:SCHOOL]</sub></span> has fertile soil at this point because it <span style='background-color:#00CDFF'>talks about how the school children are now<sub>[TOPIC:SCHOOL]</sub></span> <span style='background-color:#00CDFF'>able to eat lunch at school. A concluding<sub>[TOPIC:SCHOOL]</sub></span> reason why Sauri, Kenya will most likely improve by the year 2035 is because they have <span style='background-color:#00CDFF'>had a lot to go through and a<sub>[TOPIC:SCHOOL]</sub></span> lot of hard times, but its all better now." It says in paragraph 12 (or the last paragraph) about how "Dramatic changes have occurred in 80 villages across the sub-Saharan Africa. """ As you can see, Kenya has changed its villages dramatically since 2010." Poverty is almost over for the country of Kenya but it will continue to grow tremendously over the years.
